## üöÄ Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run the tax calculator
bun run index.ts
```

## üìÅ Setup

### 1. Configure Data Sources
Edit `config/data-sources.json` to point to your transaction files:

```json
{
  "transactions": {
    "bitcoin-de": {
      "full": "data/transactions/bitcoin-de-transactions.csv"
    },
    "kraken": {
      "ledgers-2017": "data/transactions/kraken-ledgers-2017.csv"
    }
  },
  "historicalPrices": {
    "btc-eur-2016": "data/historical-prices/btc-eur-2016.csv",
    "btc-eur-2017": "data/historical-prices/btc-eur-2017.csv"
  }
}
```

### 2. Place Transaction Files
Put your exchange exports in `data/transactions/`:
- Bitcoin.de transaction export
- Kraken ledger export

### 3. Optional: Configure Logging
Create `config/logger.json` for custom logging (optional):

```json
{
  "level": "INFO",
  "features": {
    "transferDetection": "DEBUG",
    "taxCalculations": "off",
    "priceData": "WARN"
  }
}
```

## üá©üá™ German Tax Law Compliance

### FIFO Method (First-In-First-Out)
- Oldest purchases are used first for calculating gains/losses
- Required by German tax law for cryptocurrencies
- Chronological processing ensures compliance

### One-Year Holding Period Exemption
- Assets held for more than one year are tax-exempt (¬ß 23 EStG)
- Applies to both sales and withdrawals
- Automatically calculated and displayed separately

### Transfer Detection
- Movements between exchanges are identified and marked non-taxable
- Exact amount matching with configurable time tolerance
- Prevents double taxation of internal transfers

### Disposal Events
- **Sales**: Taxable when converting crypto to EUR
- **Withdrawals**: Taxable when moving crypto off-exchange  
- **Transfers**: Non-taxable movements between your own accounts
- **Market Pricing**: Uses historical price data for accurate valuations

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Market Prices**: Withdrawal valuations use estimated prices (last purchase rate). For accurate tax filing, replace with actual market rates at withdrawal time.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Professional Advice**: This tool provides calculations based on common interpretations of German tax law. Consult a tax professional for official advice.

‚úÖ **Accuracy**: The calculator implements proper FIFO methodology and one-year exemption rules as required by German law.To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.19. [Bun](https://bun.com) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
